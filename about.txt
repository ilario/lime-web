LibreMesh is a community and an open project, so anyone friendly is welcome.
We encourage anyone using the LibreMesh to become part of this community.
The software is maintained by a wide community, a list of contributors to the LibreMesh development can be found in each code repository (e.g. https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/graphs/contributors[here] for the main repository).
