Changing WiFi interface behavior
===============================

== LibreMesh WiFi config

The general config WiFi section is used for configuring WiFi devices if there are not specific sections.

For more information about the general LibreMesh config file options see link:/docs/en_config.html[config].

== Specific wireless interface configuration

To make a specific configuration you must create a new wifi section named radio**N**, where **N** is the radio index (to see WiFi devices list execute: +wifi status+).

The following example shows how to configure specific WiFi devices.

In the example radio0 is used only for wireless client, radio1 is used only for Access Point with a custom ESSID name, and radio2 just for meshing.

.WiFi interface specific options (override general option), multiple allowed
----
config wifi radio0
	list modes 'client'
	option channel 'auto'
	option client_ssid 'SomeWiFiNetwork'
	option client_key 'SomeWPApskPassword'
	option client_encryption 'psk2'

config net wirelessclientWAN
	option linux_name 'wlan0-sta'
	list protocols 'wan'
----

The first section configures one wireless radio to be only a wireless client of an access point.
The second section configures the just created client interface for obtaining an IP from the access point DHCP.

These two new sections must be appended in file **/etc/config/lime** in addition to the already existing ones.

Here radio1 is configured for just being an AP with custom ESSID name, each specified option overrides the respective general wifi option (listed in link:en_config.html[config] page), all the non-specified options (like +distance+ or +channel+) are taken from the general wifi section.
Specifying an entry of a list, replaces the entire list.

----
config wifi radio1
	list modes 'apname'
	option apname_ssid 'MyHouse'
----

----
config wifi radio2
	list modes 'ieee80211s'
	option ieee80211s_mesh_fwding '0'
	option ieee80211s_mesh_id 'LiMe'
----

To apply the changes run **lime-config** and **reboot**.

[NOTE]
.interface names
=======================
In the just reported example, +radio0+ has to exist (check with +wifi status+) and also +wlan0-sta+ has to be created by the first section in order to be used in the second section (check with +ip link show+). 
=======================

[NOTE]
.Network interface specific options
=======================
Available protocols: bmx6, bmx7, batadv, olsr, olsr6, olsr2, bgp, wan, lan, manual, static, babeld, apbb, client

proto:vlan_number works too (something like bmx6:13 is supported). If VLAN is 0, no VLAN will be used.

If you use manual do not specify other protocols, may result in an unpredictable behavior/configuration.
