Changing network interface behavior
===================================

== LibreMesh network config

Most of the LibreMesh configuration is handled by a unified configuration file placed on **/etc/config/lime**.
This file is part of the https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/uci[UCI] database which unifies also most of the OpenWrt configuration files.
For applying the changes to the +/etc/config/lime+ configuration file, the _lime-config_ script has to be invoked executing +lime-config+ in the node's root terminal.

In addition to _/etc/config/lime_ there exist also _/etc/config/lime-defaults_. 
If a configuration option is not found in +/etc/config/lime+, the +/etc/config/lime-defaults+ one will be used when running the _lime-config_ command.

[NOTE]
.lime config file
=================
The idea behind this structure is that the user **only** modifies _/etc/config/lime_ but never _/etc/config/lime-defaults_.

Once the file is modified the command _lime-config_ must be run. To enable the changes you might reboot the node (**reboot** command).
=================

For a detailed view of the config file options see link:/docs/en_config.html[config].

The networking options of _config/lime_ are defined in two different blocks.

== Common network options

If there is not a specific network section for a specific network device, the options from the common section will be used.

.Networking default options
----
config lime network
	option primary_interface eth0
	option main_ipv4_address '10.%N1.0.0/16'
	option main_ipv6_address '2a00:1508:0a%N1:%N200::/64'
	option bmx6_mtu '1398'
	list protocols adhoc
	list protocols lan
	list protocols anygw
	list protocols batadv:%N1
	list protocols bmx6:13
	list resolvers 4.2.2.2
	list resolvers 2001:470:20::2
----

In this example, all networks interfaces will be used with the following set of protocols:

. **lan** so client devices can connect and obtain a valid IP configuration via DHCP
. **anygw** so roaming will be enabled
. **adhoc** so if WiFi device, it will be used for meshing in Ad-Hoc mode
. **batadv** so the Layer2 network routing protocol will be enabled to find possible neighbour nodes (VLAN of the mesh cloud based on SSID)
. **bmx6** so the Layer3 network routing protocol will be enabled to find possible neighbour nodes (VLAN 13)

== Specific network options

But if we want to change the default behavior of one or more network devices we can define a specific configuration.

.Ethernet specific options, multiple allowed
----
config net wan_network
	option linux_name 'eth0'
	list protocols 'wan'
	list protocols 'bmx6:13'
	list protocols 'batadv:%N1'
----

In this case the eth0 device will be used as WAN (so the DHCP client will be enabled) but also for meshing (enable routing protocols does not hurt!).

The option linux_name must coincide with the real interface name of the system, the command _ip link_ can be used to list the network devices.

[NOTE]
.lime config file
=================
If the LibreMesh module **lime-hwd-openwrt-wan** is installed (it is by default) and your node have two or more ethernet ports, 
LibreMesh might autoconfigure as WAN one of these network ethernet device.

In this case there will be a new specific configuration section like this one: 
----
config net 'lm_hwd_openwrt_wan'
	option autogenerated 'true'
----

If we want to change the behavior of this specific network device we must set autogenerated to **false**.
