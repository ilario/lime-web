The Configuration file
======================

== The Configuration file

The configuration file placed on **/etc/config/lime** is one of the key points for LibreMesh.
It contains a set of basic options which are used by LibreMesh backend to perform its magic.
The special program **lime-config** reads such file and applies the configuration to the operating system.
The default options (those which are not defined by the user in the config file) are read from **/etc/config/lime-defaults**, 
which should not be modified.


Some options are parametrizable with a set of special characters which will be substituted for some specific node data.

. **MAC bytes** [%Mn] refers to the MAC address of the primary interface. Example from CA:FF:EE:BA:BB:EE %M1=CA and %M4=BA
. **Network Identifier** [%Nn] refers to the cloud identifier byte which is a hash of the AP SSID.
. **Hostname** [%H] Refers to the hostname of the node

[NOTE]
==============
Note that there is no need to manual configure any of the config file options unless you know what are you doing. 
In most of the scenarios the default options defined in lime-defaults should work fine.
==============

=== List of sections and options

For detailed information on each of the options, check the https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/blob/master/packages/lime-docs/files/lime-example[/docs/lime-example] file.

.System options
----
config lime system
	option hostname 'LiMe-%M4%M5%M6'
	option domain 'lan'
	option keep_on_upgrade 'libremesh base-files-essential /etc/sysupgrade.conf'
----

We suggest to change the domain from +lan+ to your community's website, for example +option domain 'altermundi.net'+.

.Network general options
----
config lime network
	option primary_interface 'eth0'
	option main_ipv4_address '10.%N1.0.0/16'
	option anygw_dhcp_start '2'
	option anygw_dhcp_limit '0'
	option main_ipv6_address '2a00:1508:0a%N1:%N200::/64'
	list protocols ieee80211s
	list protocols lan

	option bmx6_wifi_rate_max 54000000
	option bmx7_mtu '1500'
	option bmx7_publish_ownip false
	option bmx7_over_batman false
	option bmx7_pref_gw none
	option bmx7_wifi_rate_max 'auto'
	option anygw_mac "aa:aa:aa:%N1:%N2:aa"
	option use_odhcpd false

[NOTE]
.main_ipv4_address
================
Here you have 4 possibilities: 

. set a static IP and the subnet, like '192.0.2.1/16' 

. parametrize with %Mn and %Nn, and set the subnet, like '192.%N1.%M5.%M6/16'; 

. set a whole network address (so not a specific IP) for getting the IP autocompleted in that network with bits from MAC address, this works also with netmasks other than /24 or /16, like '192.0.128.0/17' 

. set two different parameters, the first for subnet and the second for the node IP parametrization, like '192.0.128.0/16/17', this results in /16 subnet but the node IP will be calculated in a /17 range.

================

[NOTE]
.main_ipv6_address
================
Parametrizable in the same way as main_ipv4_address. If used, the IP autocompletion will fill maximum the last 24 bits, 
so specifying an IP autocompletion range bigger than /104 is not useful.
================

[NOTE]
.list protocols
================
List of protocols configured by LibreMesh, some of these require the relative package "lime-proto-...". 
Note that if you set here some protocols, you overwrite the **whole** list of protocols set in /etc/config/lime-defaults.
Don't worry if all protocols are defined here: just the actually installed ones will be active.
================


.WiFi general options
----
config lime wifi
	option channel_2ghz '11'
	list channel_5ghz '157'
	list channel_5ghz '48'
	option htmode_5ghz 'HT40'
	option distance_2ghz '100'
	option distance_5ghz '1000'
	list modes 'ap'
	list modes 'apname'
	list modes 'ieee80211s'
	option ap_ssid 'LibreMesh.org'
	option apname_ssid 'LibreMesh.org/%H'
	option adhoc_ssid 'LiMe'
	option adhoc_bssid 'ca:fe:00:c0:ff:ee'
	option adhoc_mcast_rate_2ghz '24000'
	option adhoc_mcast_rate_5ghz '6000'
	option ieee80211s_mesh_fwding '0'
	option ieee80211s_mesh_id 'LiMe'
----

[NOTE]
.country code
=============
The country code is not specified by default (so that the default is US), but we strongly recommend to specify it, for example in Spain setting +option country 'ES'+ you can access the channel 13 which otherwise is restricted.
=============

[NOTE]
.distance
=============
Distance parameter indicates the maximum distance of the wireless connected devices.
A much too large value would decrease the performances but even a slightly too small value can result in a non-working connection.
=============

[NOTE]
.wifi options
=============
Any option with name <mode>_<option> will be directly copied to /etc/config/wireless (without the <mode>_ prefix)
=============

[NOTE]
.wifi WPA2 encryption
=============
In order to have WPA2-PSK encryption on the AP and APname interfaces, add a +_key 'somePassword'+ and a +_encryption 'psk2'+ options for each, for having an example see https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/blob/master/packages/lime-docs/files/lime-example[/docs/lime-example].
=============

[NOTE]
.wifi 80211s
=============
Mode ieee80211s refers to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11s[802.11s] standard (known as mesh). When +option ieee80211s_mesh_fwding '0'+ is present, the routing layer is disabled and it can be used only as a link-layer protocol such as adhoc.
Be aware that it cannot be used together with adhoc on the same interface.
=============

=== Specific interface configuration

Changing the aforementioned options allows us to have a system-wide configuration.

In cases where different network interfaces should have different configurations, see link:en_changing_network_behavior.html[Change network behavior] page and https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/blob/master/packages/lime-docs/files/lime-example[/docs/lime-example].
